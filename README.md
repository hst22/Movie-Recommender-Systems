Recommender systems can create great strategic advantages for companies that implement them, and customer satisfaction can be achieved along with customer loyalty. In this project, we have successfully built and studied the advantages & limitations of four different recommendation systems:
1.	Demographic Filtering based 
2.	Content-based
3.	Collaborative Filtering based
4.	Hybrid Filtering based

Studying the results of all recommender systems, we observed that Demographic filtering is very elementary and cannot be used practically, Content-based filter is good at identifying very similar styles movies. Collaborative filtering is good at spanning gaps across genres and consistently recommending movies with high ratings. The Hybrid filtering takes advantage of Content-based and Collaborative filtering and gives the best quality recommendations. It beautifully combines the concepts of Content-based and Collaborative Filtering to build an engine that gives movie suggestions to a particular user based on the estimated ratings that it had internally calculated for that user.
